\title{A Measure of Top-Down Correlation}
\usage{
tdcc(ranks, pearson = FALSE, plot = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{ranks}{[\code{matrix(nrow = b, ncol = k)}]\cr
\code{(bxk)}-matrix of the ranks of the \code{k}
variables for each of the \code{b} sensitivity analyses, ties are neglected,
must be integers.}

\item{pearson}{[\code{logical(1)}]\cr
Should the ordinary Pearson coefficient with
Savage scores be computed (\code{b = 2})? Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{plot}{[\code{logical(1)}]\cr
Should scatter plots showing rankings and Savage scores be created
(\code{b = 2})? Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A named vector with components:
\itemize{
  \item{\code{kendall}}: Coefficient of concordance.
  \item{\code{pearson}}: Pearson coefficient (only if \code{pearson = TRUE}).
}
}
\description{
With the use of Savage scores, the Top-Down Correlation Coefficient TDCC 
compares \code{b} rankings.
}
\details{
NOTE: As the implementation of the coefficient of concordance is still defective,
please use the Pearson coefficient!
}
\examples{
# b=2 sensitivity analysis techniques A and B that rate the influence of 
# k=20 variables/ input parameters (example taken from Iman and Conover, 1987):
ranking <- rbind(A = 1:20,
                 B = c(1,3,2,4,16,10,19,12,18,17,
                       20,5,14,7,8,11,6,15,9,13))
tdcc(ranking, pearson = TRUE, plot = TRUE)
